**A bulk-import automation tool to populate your self-hosted recipe managers with high-quality recipes.**

This script automates the process of finding **new** recipes. It scans a curated list of high-quality food blogs, detects new posts via sitemaps, checks if you already have them in your library, and imports them automatically.

## 🚀 Features

* **Multi-Platform:** Supports importing to **Mealie**, **Tandoor**, or both simultaneously.
* **Smart Deduplication:** Checks your existing libraries first. It will never import a URL you already have.
* **Recipe Verification:** Scans candidate pages for Schema.org JSON-LD to ensure it only imports actual recipes.
* **Deep Sitemap Scanning:** Automatically parses XML sitemaps to find the most recent posts.
* **Curated Source List:** Comes pre-loaded with over 100+ high-quality food blogs covering African, Caribbean, East Asian, Latin American, and General Western cuisines.
